# pneumonia_detection_cnn

In this repository, I have implemented a Pneumonia Detection CNN using two different models: Smallnet (sequential network) and VGG16. These models are trained to classify chest X-ray images into two categories: "Normal" and "Pneumonia." The evaluation process involves computing precision, recall, accuracy, AUC, and generating ROC curves for both models. Additionally, this provide the ability to make predictions on new chest X-ray images, displaying the model's prediction and the probability of pneumonia. The models can be saved and loaded for future use, allowing integration into healthcare applications for pneumonia detection.
The provided code encompasses model evaluation, image prediction, and model saving/loading.
